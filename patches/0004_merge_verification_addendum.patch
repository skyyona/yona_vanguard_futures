+6) Read-only runtime trace & request persistence (added by recent patch)
+   - Purpose: aid post-mortem and reproducibility by emitting a compact orchestrator runtime snapshot
+     and persisting the full incoming strategy request parameters in backtest artifacts.
+   - Runtime trace (non-invasive): `StrategyOrchestrator.step()` now logs a single-line, read-only
+     entry `orchestrator_trace` containing: `symbol`, `cfg.order_quantity`, `cfg.leverage`,
+     `last_signal.score`, `entry_signal` and `position_size`. This log is purely informational
+     and will not change runtime behavior.
+   - Artifact persistence: `StrategySimulator.run_simulation()` includes a deep-copied
+     `request_parameters` field in the returned results dictionary so saved backtest JSONs
+     will contain the full request payload used for that run.
+   - How to verify:
+     - Run a backtest via the API or scripts and inspect logs for lines containing
+       `orchestrator_trace` to see the compact snapshot.
+     - Inspect backtest result JSON (`backtest_results/*.json` or returned API payload)
+       and confirm presence of `request_parameters` with the expected keys/values.
+   - Notes:
+     - The trace avoids any sensitive fields and is logged at INFO level.
+     - If any non-serializable objects are present in parameters, they are stored as
+       a string fallback to avoid breaking result generation.
