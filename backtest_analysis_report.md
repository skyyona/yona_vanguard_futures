## High-level assessment
- Average final profit% across analyzed backtests: 12.1253%
- Average win rate across analyzed backtests: 22.77%

## Fit to 3% TP scalping goal
- The report below shows per-symbol how often individual trades achieved >=3% net profit (as % of initial balance).
- Desired properties for the strategy to reliably compound at ~3% per-trade:
  - A substantial fraction of trades should hit >=3% TP (recommended > 20%).
  - Win rate sufficiently high to overcome losses and trading costs (example: win_rate > 50% if average win near 3% and average loss similar magnitude).
  - Low max_drawdown relative to capital to avoid blowups.

### BTCUSDT assessment
- 18.92% of trades reached >=3% TP.
- BELOW recommended per-trade TP frequency (improvement needed).
- Average trade %: -0.1046%, Median: -8.7400%.
- Average trade below 3% — strategy on average does not deliver 3% per trade.
- Win rate: 21.62162162162162%, Max DD: 136.79825104153795%.
- Very large drawdown observed; capital protection / risk sizing must be improved.

## Recommended optimization directions
- Filter entries for stronger momentum: require multi-timeframe confirmation (e.g., 15m EMA alignment + 5m entry).
- Use a volatility-adaptive position sizing so that a 3% TP corresponds to a fixed volatility band (ATR-based sizing).
- Tighten exits: explicitly set TP at 3% with a short timeout; test using different SL rules (e.g., -1% fixed, ATR-based).
- Reduce exposure on low-liquidity / high-slippage symbols; prefer high-liquidity coins.
- Add pre-entry filters: volume spike, spread check, and avoid trading across major news.
- Perform parameter grid search for TP/SL/entry thresholds and re-run on walk-forward windows.
- Add transaction costs and slippage modeling in backtests to ensure 3% TP survives real conditions.
- Consider shorter holding-time heuristics and limit max trade duration to avoid large adverse moves.

## Next steps / actions to implement
1. Run parameter sweep for TP in [1%,2%,3%,4%,5%] with SL in [-0.5%,-1%,-2%] across symbols and intervals.
2. Implement ATR-based position sizing so that risk per trade is capped (e.g., 0.5% of capital).
3. Add multi-timeframe EMA alignment filter and test improvement in TP attainment.
4. Re-run extended backtests with realistic fees/slippage and produce a final recommended set of params for live testing.
